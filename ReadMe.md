2. Next, you must set up the actions toolkit packagesâ€™ actions/core and actions/github in the custom actions folder. To
   do this, you need to execute the following commands (also see Figure 9-3).

   ```
   npm install @actions/core
   npm install @actions/github
   ```
3. To compile the code and the modules for distribution, you can use @vercel/ncc, which you must first install. Execute
   ``` 
   npm i -g @vercel/ncc to install @vercel/ncc/ in the terminal (see Figure 9-5).
   ```
4. Now you can build the distribution package for the action by using the following command (see Figure 9-6).
   ```
   ncc build index.js --license licenses.txt
   ```
5. The following commands commit and push the action files to the repo (see Figure 9-10).
   ```   
   git commit -m "First js action is ready"
   git tag -a -m "First js action release" v1
   git push --follow-tags
   ```
